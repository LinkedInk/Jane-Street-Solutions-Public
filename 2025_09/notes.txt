MY STEPS (to arrive at the most common wrong answer, reflections at the bottom)

Extra rules/clues

1) Hooks build and peel off like onion layers, hooks of adjacent sizes must share at least 2 edges
2) Hooks contain multiple of the same number, meaning it cannot contain a number bigger than it can hold
 2.1) Hook capacity changes based on values outside the grid

-With these 2 extra rules, all hooks except the 5x5 and the 6x6 can be fixed in position

-Z and V pentominos can be fixed in position using values outside the grid, and the existing position of 8 and 9

-U and X pentominos can be fixed in position based on the max number of numbers a hook can hold and values outside grid

-The rest of the pentominos were guessed together at once
    N must contain 2 7's
    I must be horizontal otherwise there is no space

THINGS I MISSED OUT (and therefore solved it incorrectly)
1) Finally, the sum of the of the values in each pentomino must be a multiple of 5. 
    I seem to have just not seen this line
2) The filled squares must form a connected region. 
    I thought it meant to be connected together to form a pentomino.
    Rather than all the filled squares must be part of the same island.
    Perhaps it would be better phrased as "form one connected region"
